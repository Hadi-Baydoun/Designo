# Designo

This repository showcases my solution to the Designo Multipage Website challenge by Frontend Mentor. The challenge involved creating a responsive multi-page website based on a provided design. Designo is a fictional web design agency that offers various services to its clients.

In my implementation, I carefully analyzed the design files provided and meticulously translated them into functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The website consists of multiple pages, each focusing on different aspects of Designo's services, including web design, graphic design, and branding.

To ensure a seamless user experience, I employed modern web development techniques and best practices. The website is fully responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. I utilized CSS Flexbox to create a visually appealing and dynamic design that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

To maintain a clean and organized codebase, I followed a modular approach by dividing the project into reusable components and utilizing appropriate CSS naming conventions. I also ensured the code's readability, maintainability, and scalability, making it easier for future developers to understand and extend the project.

I leveraged modern development tools, such as Git, to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain version control. The repository contains all the necessary files and assets required to run the website locally or deploy it to a live server.
